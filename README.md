# bad apple, but checkbox webpage


yeah, so it's a page where there is bad apple animated with checkboxes

[you can see it here](https://bewuwy.github.io/bad-apple-checkbox/badapple/index.html)

i generated the scripts using python (PIL) and ffmpeg (extracted the frames from the mp4)

### DISCLAIMER:
i do not own the music audio for this song
